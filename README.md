### BlazorConnect (The Blazor Interop for WalletConnectModal)
Interoperability layer for integrating the official WalletConnect modal into Blazor applications. WalletConnect is a protocol that facilitates the communication between decentralized applications (DApps) and mobile wallets by using QR code scanning or deep linking for a secure connection without the need to reveal private keys. The main objective of this interop is to enable Blazor, a web framework using C# and .NET, to seamlessly interact with WalletConnect's functionalities. This integration will allow Blazor applications to incorporate cryptocurrency transactions and wallet management by communicating with the WalletConnect API, thus expanding the usability of Blazor apps in the blockchain ecosystem.
